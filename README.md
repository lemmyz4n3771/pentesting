# Pentesting
These are a collection of my notes on approaching hacking problems and red teaming. They are observations and strategies that I've made in the course of hacking different machines. I write them here to formulate my own red-teaming strategies and share them in the spirit of public learning. Most of these are ideas that I've had to come up with on my own because I couldn't find them anywhere else.
