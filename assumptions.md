## Assumptions and their Cost

I like new and exotic problems. I like working on things I've not seen before. I gravitate to such experiences and like to spend time solving them. My mind likes to see the world differently and see things beneath the surface.

There is a problem with thinking like this in the field: not all ways that move you forward will be new and exciting. Misconfigurations leading to compromise often are boring, the results of laziness and convenience.  If there is any difficulty associated with getting passed such problems, it is believing someone to be so stupid or counterintuitive.

The effect of this wisdom is to assume less. Assuming someone to be more creative than he is will mean you miss an attack vector. It's almost like you're not playing your opponent, but the opponent you wanted to play. At the very least, the game your playing is not the same as your opponent's, and this incongruence will actually make it harder for you to think like him and find his mistakes to exploit them.

Questioning every assumption is a lot of work, but, in doing this, the pinch you'll feel first is not in the amount of work to be done:  it's the sense of inefficiency. "Surely," you'll think, "there are better ways to spend one's time," so you'll look for the vulnerability elsewhere and miss one. Even as you suspend your assumptions and work through every simple mistake the admin or dev could have made, the thought of inefficiency will gnaw at the back of your mind that you're wasting your time and should move on.

To counteract the sense of inefficiency, consider the competing interest of being thorough. You want to thoroughly test each endpoint and document it. This is not seen in a lot of writeups because it is tedious to the reader and seems superfluous after the fact. But it is part and parcel to the pentest.

Nevertheless,  there are times when the target's underlying structure is more predictable than others, and it may be safe to operate on some assumptions to advance before getting too bogged down early on. The standard installation is obviously one such example. More generally though, I've observed that the more personal a setup, the more you should suspend your assumptions about how its organized. Conversely, the more a setup is to be used by many different people, the more you can expect its organization and configuration to be efficiently done and more predictable.
