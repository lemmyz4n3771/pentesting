## Detecting Unfamiliar Vulnerabilities

Recognizing an attack vector is a product of enumeration and experience. If you haven't sufficiently enumerated the target machine, it won't show up on the map. If you don't have enough experience with this sort of vulnerability, it will look like everything else and you'll not detect it. 

As long as your enumeration is good, it is possible to detect a vulnerability that you haven't had much, if any, prior experience exploiting. For this to work, though, it's a prerequisite that you'll have to have enough general pentesting experience with vulnerability exploitation to feel your way through.

First, you'll need to know what looks different, which requires you to have a good idea of what is standard. This is assuming you've not seen the vulnerability before. If you have, then it will jump out at you and it should be trivial to exploit it. What is different then becomes the set of elements in the testing space.

Next, determine the relationship between these elements and 1) themselves, 2) the rest of the services in the system that you haven't done much with yet, and 3) the services and configurations of the system that you know and understand already. If you proceed to do this in order,  then you'll be attaching meaning from unknowns to knowns. It's faster to work backwards like this, similar to beginning at the end of a maze and working towards the beginning.

Once you have a better idea of what the elements in the testing set do, it's time to search online for CVEs and PoCs. If these don't directly tell you how to exploit the situation, then it might point you in the right direction. At the very least, you'll be able to eliminate attack vectors that won't work, leaving you with a smaller set to still test for.

If, by now, the vulnerability doesn't present itself, take your better understanding of the system and the reduced list of possibilities and compare them as before to see if anything in your understanding has changed. If nothing has changed,  then proceed with additional enumeration that targets specifically the possibilities that remain.

If there is a vulnerability to exploit, it should begin to stand out more than others after this process. What remains then is how to exploit it. Hopefully, you'll be able to search for the vulnerability with sufficient specificity to find research already on it to go by. Find the closest PoC that applies to your situation and tweak it until it works.
