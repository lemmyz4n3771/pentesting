## Guesses and Lucky Guesses

Getting ahead sometimes means having to make a lucky guess. It's completely possible for you to have attempted to solve a problem in a measured, insightful, and comprehensive way and still get nowhere. These situations include finding the right username, password, directory path, bad characters, service names as well as their versions, figuring out a nagging error in thr dark (such as when there is no error output), and more. Like with luck in general, your experience level can limit the extent to which you really have to rely on luck, but luck is, nevertheless, a factor.

Lucky guessing is to be distinguished from simply guessing, which occurs throughout the pentest. Guessing is a means of getting your bearings in an unknown environment. It's the mathematical equivalent of plugging in numbers in a function to see how the function behaves. Lucky guessing, on the other hand, occurs when you have to make a larger than average inference from what you're given to get ahead, such that it really looks like luck was the deciding factor, however small. 

Guessing as a strategy occurs at the beginning and at the end of problem solving. It's used at the beginning to check for default configuration, test for known vulnerabilities in initially standard ways (e.g. injection, XSS, SSRF) before getting more creative, and for purposes of enumeration, like fuzzing. It then usually occurs at the end of a problem solving attempt, after all your attempts to automate a solution fail, at which point it takes the form of lucky guessing.

If you've done your work properly on the problem on the front end, any lucky guessing you do after that should be much more educated than if you had simply resorted to lucky guessing as your initial strategy. You'll have a much better idea of what hasn't worked so far, thereby reducing the problem space. This means that the most reliable way to make a lucky guess and succeed is to have done lots of work in advance and failed many times before "guessing" right once. 

That's a bit of a paradox: it's not simply a lucky guess if you've had to systematically attack the problem in a methodical way to better understand it and reduce your chances of being wrong, and, at the same time, the number of things you still haven't tried can seem infinite, so picking out a possible solution from this still looks like luck.
