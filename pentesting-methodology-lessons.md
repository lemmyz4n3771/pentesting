## Pentesting Methodology Lessons

Some lessons I've learned that have helped refine my pentesting methodology:

Not all scans will reveal everything in one go. Nmap is like this, so are web fuzzers like gobuster. If you don't realize this, you advance with false confidence, which makes it harder to diagnose problems down the line, especially when you get stuck. I'm the kind of person who likes to advance after he's sure of a strategy. But if you adopt this approach too narrowly and trust too deeply that you're sure that all your information gathered heretofore is correct, then, when you don't know what to do next, you'll feel the situation is impossible, which can be devastating to your morale. So don't consider it a bad thing to remain skeptical before moving forward; instead, feel confident that remaining skeptical is a good strategy.

Because of the above, the answer to being stuck isn't just "enumerate harder," it's also "backtrack more." This step gets ignored often in writeups, but it is there. When to backtrack is difficult to determine because it requires a hunch about what's going on. A good hunch is directly proportional to experience. If you don't have a good hunch, the alternative is to try again and try differently, gradually, and by degrees.

Realizing the value of certain information and findings is also proportional to experience. But, in some cases, particular contrived circumstances in a CTF, what something is and why it is available are not questions that can be answered immediately. You'll have to set informstion aside and also not forget about it. This can be achieved with a good note-taking system. I keep two sets of notes: one that keeps track of my steps and commands, another to put information, like creds, for repeated use 

At some point while hacking, I have experienced a state of feeling completely alone, in the dark, in an unfamiliar place, uncertain of what to do next, perhaps even aware I'm being watched. If you experience this feeling, and you think about it too much, it can be devastating and you'll want to pack up and retreat to a place of safety. Although the solution is, ultimately,  not to think about it, it does no good tell yourself, "Just don't think about it" when it happens. 

There are several ways of overcoming this problem, the most reliable of which is to take a break. Do something else that occupies your mind for a short while, then return feeling slightly refreshed. Having stepped back from the problem, you will see the problem with better eyes. 

Sometimes, however, even during a break, the negative feeling of the unknown may not entirely leave you, which can undermine your attempt to rest. This is one reason the type of break matters. Looking outside a window may not be enough, but maybe exercise is, or playing an engaging game, or having an interesting conversation. The point is engaging your mind in something else to truly put down the hacking problem. If you have done this, then you can be said to have, indeed, rested.

While this is a good strategy that anyone can do, it should be considered a fallback mechanism because the better result is achieved through self-discipline. It is in fact possible to make familiar the unfamiliar. 

I see the state of unfamiliarity to have both a knowledge and a feeling component. The knowledge component is different from situstion to situation becsuse the subject will be different. Unfamiliarity of knowledge can be overcome through research and effort. If your skills at research are good, you can feel confident in your ability to handle this prong of unfamiliarity. As for the feeling of unfamiliarity, this is always the same, no matter the subject, no matter where you are. And therein lies its weakness: the more you expose yourself to the unfamiliar, the more familiar it becomes, until it becomes your home away from home. Unfamiliarity is part of hacking, not foreign to it. Unfamiliarity is one reason why hacking is fun, without which it would be boring. A hacker seeks out the unfamiliar, not shy away from it.
