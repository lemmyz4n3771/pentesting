## The Scarecrow's Field

Remaining resolute in the face of extreme pessimism is as much a part of hacking as the technical side of it. You are always going uphill. You are always facing resistence. The environment is hostile to your presence and will punish you for your mistakes. It is difficult to find answers to your questions. Because you are not supposed to be here and you are not supposed to know. Your existence is not a given. In fact, you are hunted.  You were not invited, yet you dared to try, and will have to fight to stay.

Success depends on not being intimidated by this reality, so this is another skill to develop. It helps not to think about the above, and I've noticed that, after getting a foothold on a machine or hooks in a network,  the feeling dissipates. But until that point, it can creep up on you. This implies that this security feature is on the front end, making it a deterrent.

I refuse to believe that something man-made is completely secure. If a design borrows its strength from nature, like mathematics, then I'm up against nature, which is a different story. But protocols are man-made, as is software, and that's more than enough for an attacker to work with. As such, I consider it a matter of time, effort, and insight to discover a vulnerability.

The initial feeling, then, that the foothold cannot be had is misleading. This is by design and is nothing new. It functions just a scarecrow in a field. It is much easier to deal with a threat by keeping it outside the castle walls than removing it from the inside. I first noticed this after looking at the names of some of the harder machines on HackTheBox and at OffSec, whose names can be intimidating, as well as their labled difficulty level. At first, I avoided them because I thought they were out of my league. Then I went ahead and tried them and some of them weren't so bad. Not all machines are named, but they might require a lot of enumeration before you can find the single vulnerability that leads to the foothold. And before you find that vulnerability, you might think that there is none because you're drowning in endpoints to examine and test. Indeed, the field to examine to plan your attack can be vast, oftentimes deliberately so to wear you down and keep you at bay. In the process of doing lots of enumeratation and making apparently no headway, it's as if you are looking up from the field and seeing something big and scary and difficult that prevents you from making progress. This is intentional. It's an expected defense. But it remains static, like a scarecrow. 

The system's main initial deterrent is you believing that it isn't vulnerable, like believing the scarecrow to be human. The trick is to realize that it's only a scarecrow that occupies the field at the beginning. Every bit of it is designed to scare intruders into compliance. It will try to scare you with services and frameworks that you don't yet know about. It will try to scare you with sheer breadth, depth and intricacy of design. It will try to scare you with a sea of data. However the setup is fixed, constant, and unmoving, and there is a way in. The scarecrow setup is just a distraction. Once you do find the vulnerability, you can see that the difficulty and the system's defenses were a creature of your own making. At that point, the illusion is dispelled, and you can walk right past the straw guard.
